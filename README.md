# Welcome to **Design System** ðŸŽ¨
- Design System is the fifth Ignite project and challenge in the React trail 2022.   
- It was developed following the **monorepo strategy**, where each package is a project dependent on the others.     
- Packages of **tokens**, components encoded in **react**, components **documentation** etc. were developed.
- Packages published in **npm**:
